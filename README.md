Solving Einstein's riddle using linear programming
=====================================================

This repository includes a solution of what is mentioned as Einstein's riddle  to find the fish.

The problem is posed as an integer linear program and solved using Yalmip. Yalmip is a free Matalb toolbox for optimization problems. It is included in this repository under the `/yalmip` directory to simplify running the solution but could otherwise be downloaded from the [official source](http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/).

It follows the clues as presented in this [TedEd video](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-einstein-s-riddle-dan-van-der-vieren).
